## xRegistry contributors

<!-- no verify-links -->

We welcome you to join us! This list acknowledges those who contribute whether
it be via GitHub pull request or in real life in the project, as well as those
who contributed before this became a CNCF project. If you are participating in
some way, please add your information via pull request.

This list is intended to build community, helping the project to connect github
handles to real world identities and get to know each other, and for new folks
to see who has been involved already.

Contributions do not constitute an official endorsement.
